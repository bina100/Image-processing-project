## A project to identify shoe footprints at a crime scene by processing an image

### question 1 (projectIM2020_q1.py)

 Two goals- first, isolate and find the area of the shoe footprint in the picture. And second, mark on the measuring bar the chessboard.
 
 Input: An image of footprints of an arena shoe in a field that includes a measuring bar.
 Output: 1. Mark red dots in the corners of the chessboard on the measuring bar.
         2. Only a cropped image of the shoe footprint without the ruler.
         
### question 2 (projectIM2020_q2.py)

 Circular patterns should be found in the soles of shoe pictures.

 Input: Image set of shoe soles.
 Output: Highlight the areas in the image that illustrate circular patterns.

### question 3 (projectIM2020_q3.py)

 We would like to simulate a "search engine" which gets an image of a piece of sole and finds the most suitable sole from database images of   footprints.

 Input: 1 .Piece of a picture of shoe prints.
        2. Complete shoe trail database.
 Output: The appropriate sole for the given piece from the database.
 
 ### question 4 (projectIM2020_q4.py)
 
 Just like question 2, but this time with a real picture
 Circular patterns should be found in the footprints of shoe prints.

 Input: A real picture of shoe prints.
 Output: Highlight the areas in the image that illustrate circular patterns.
